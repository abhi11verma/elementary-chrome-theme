Elementary Chrome Theme
======================

Elementary OS Loki released and everything looks great except **CHROME**!! So I created a theme that _makes Chrome great again_.

###This is how it looks by default...

###How to install ?

#### Available on [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elementary-chrome-theme/kclhjdmlabgkilhiiehfdcmjgpficmmn?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon&authuser=1).

You can also download [latest version](https://github.com/kushalpandya/elementary-chrome-theme/releases/latest) of extension file to install it manually, go to Chrome Settings > Extensions, and drop extension `.crx` file and click Install from popup that appears.


Feel free to contribute to the project :)
